# Digital-Certificates-for-Students-RMIT-Capstone-Project-ISYS3303-

This project was developed as part of the ISYS3303 Business IT Capstone at RMIT University. Our goal was to design a secure, transparent, and verifiable Digital Certificate Issuing System for academic institutions, allowing students to showcase verified credentials (such as Digitally Adept, Critically Engaged, etc.) on professional platforms like LinkedIn.

The platform issues NFT-based certificates, stored using decentralized technologies such as IPFS, and verified using smart contracts on Ethereum/Polygon. It includes dashboards for both students and administrators, enabling real-time issuance, minting, and blockchain verification.

🧩 Key Features
✅ NFT Certificate Generation: Mint digital credentials to student-owned wallets using MetaMask.

🔐 Blockchain-Backed Verification: All certificates are tamper-proof and verifiable via smart contracts.

🧾 Decentralized Storage: Certificate metadata is stored on IPFS, ensuring permanence and transparency.

👨‍🎓 Student Dashboard: View capabilities earned, download certificates, and verify them on OpenSea.

🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard: Manage eligible students, initiate certificate creation, track minting activity.

📸 QR-Based Authentication: Certificates include QR codes linking directly to on-chain verification.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Figma (UI Design)

Backend: Node.js / Django (for API & smart contract integration)

Blockchain: Ethereum / Polygon, Solidity, MetaMask

Storage: IPFS (via Pinata), OpenSea (for NFT visibility)

Security: Smart contract auditing, GDPR-compliant data handling

Impact
✅ Promotes ownership and trust in digital credentials.

🌐 Enables global verification of student skills and achievements.

💼 Enhances employability by allowing students to showcase capabilities on LinkedIn and GitHub.

♻️ Built using scalable, low-cost, and eco-friendly blockchain solutions (e.g., Polygon).
